No equivalent record exists in current scientific literature. General minimum-energy principles exist in thermodynamics and classical mechanics, but none presents an explicit relationship between minimum spatial resolution and the experimental parameters probe energy (ε), temperature (T), number of coherent probes (N), and coherence time (τ).

### Distinctive features
- Novel integration of variables  
- Alternative experimental paradigm  
- Macro ↔ micro connection  
- Scientific metaphor (ant, aircraft carrier, matchstick)

### Potential impact
- New ultra-low energy and temperature experiments  
- Reinterpretation of quantum phenomena  
- Connections between fundamental physics and cosmology
