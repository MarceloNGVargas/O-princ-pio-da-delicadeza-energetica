Dear Editors,

I am pleased to submit my manuscript entitled *“From Macro to Micro: The Principle of Energetic Subtlety”* for consideration as a preprint on your platform.

This work introduces a new paradigm in experimental physics: the **Principle of Minimum-Energy Resolution**. Contrary to the prevailing approach that relies on colossal energies to probe the infinitely small, this principle demonstrates that true resolution is achieved through minimal energy, coherence, and subtlety. The manuscript presents a mathematical formulation that connects spatial resolution to probe energy, temperature, coherence time, and collective measurement, and it illustrates the concept through both theoretical analysis and metaphorical explanation.

The results suggest that reducing energy per probe and thermal noise, while increasing coherence and collective measurements, provides a more effective path to access the sub-quantum structural level. This approach may open new directions in ultra-low energy and temperature experiments, with implications for understanding dark energy, exotic energy, and the fundamental connection between macro and micro scales.

I believe this manuscript will be of interest to researchers in quantum physics, experimental physics, and foundational studies of matter and energy. By making this work publicly available, I hope to stimulate discussion, replication, and further exploration of this principle.

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to the opportunity to share this work with the scientific community.

Sincerely,  
Marcelo Vargas
