# Abstract

This work presents the Principle of Minimum-Energy Resolution, proposed by Marcelo Vargas, which suggests a paradigm shift in experimental physics: accessing the sub-quantum structural level does not require colossal energies, but rather conditions of minimal energy. The central hypothesis is that quantum superposition does not represent multiple states coexisting, but rather the limitation of our ability to observe the infinitely small.

The developed formula establishes that the minimum spatial resolution (δx_min) is optimized by reducing probe energy (ε) and temperature (T), while increasing coherence time (τ) and the number of coherent probes (N). This principle connects the micro to the macro, offering a possible explanation for phenomena such as dark energy and exotic energy, seen as manifestations of a structural layer not yet accessible.

The goal is to pave the way for a new experimental physics based on precision and subtlety, rather than brute force, and to encourage future investigations that may validate this principle in ultra-low energy and temperature regimes.
