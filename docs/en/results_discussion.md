# Results and Discussion

## δx_min vs Temperature (T)
As temperature increases, thermal noise (k_B T) grows and the minimum resolution δx_min worsens.  
Interpretation: here the aircraft carrier is heat — a disproportionate energy that harms precision. To “hit the ant”, thermal silence is needed, i.e., temperatures close to absolute zero.

## δx_min vs Probe Energy (ε)
Increasing energy applied per probe raises δx_min, worsening resolution.  
Interpretation: using colossal energy is like trying to crush the ant with the aircraft carrier — ineffective and disproportionate. Reducing ε approaches the matchstick regime: minimal impact, maximum precision.

## δx_min vs Number of Probes (N)
Increasing the number of coherent probes reduces δx_min.  
Interpretation: it is not brute force from a single event that matters, but the subtlety of many matchsticks acting together. Collective coherence replaces energy waste.

## δx_min vs Coherence Time (τ)
Extending integration time improves resolution.  
Interpretation: the matchstick need not be quick, but steady and precise. Coherence time is the patience that allows observation of the infinitely small without noise.

## 3D Surface δx_min vs T and ε
The surface shows that δx_min is worst when T and ε are large simultaneously.  
Interpretation: aircraft carrier + heat = absolute chaos. Only when both are minimized (T → 0, ε → 0) can the ant be precisely struck by the matchstick.

## Synthesis
The results confirm the metaphor:  
- Aircraft carrier (colossal energy): generates noise, disturbance, and fails to hit the target.  
- Matchstick (minimal energy): strikes the ant with precision, revealing the sub-quantum structural level.  

Thus, the simulation reinforces that it is not brutality that reveals the micro, but delicacy. The scientific path should be minimal energy, patience, and coherence.
