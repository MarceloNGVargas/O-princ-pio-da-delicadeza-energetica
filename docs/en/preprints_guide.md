# Preprint Submission Guide (arXiv and OSF)

## Prepare the manuscript
- Consolidate the paper in docs/pt/preprint.md and docs/en/preprint.md.
- Generate a PDF from Markdown (Pandoc or an editor that exports to PDF).

## arXiv
- Create an account at https://arxiv.org.  
- Choose a category (e.g., physics.gen-ph, quant-ph).  
- Submit the PDF and metadata (title, authors, abstract, keywords).  
- Wait for moderation and publication.

## OSF
- Create an account at https://osf.io.  
- Create a project and add a preprint.  
- Upload the PDF and metadata.  
- Publish to obtain an OSF DOI (optional).

## Recommendations
- Include links to the GitHub repository and the Zenodo DOI.  
- Add CITATION.cff to the repository and cite the DOI in the README.  
- Maintain consistency between PT and EN versions.
