# Originality and Innovation

The formula proposed in this work:

\[
\delta x_{\min} = \frac{C}{\alpha} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{k_B T + \gamma \varepsilon}}{\sqrt{N \tau}}
\]

has no equivalent record in the current scientific literature. While general principles related to minimum energy exist in thermodynamics and classical mechanics, none of them present an explicit relationship between minimum spatial resolution and the experimental parameters probe energy (ε), temperature (T), number of coherent probes (N), and coherence time (τ).

### Distinctive Features of the Proposal
- Novel integration of variables: the equation combines thermal, energetic, and coherence factors into a single expression for minimum resolution.  
- Alternative experimental paradigm: whereas traditional physics employs colossal energy to probe the micro, this formula demonstrates that resolution improves with minimal energy and greater coherence.  
- Macro ↔ micro connection: it suggests that phenomena such as dark energy and exotic energy may be manifestations of a structural layer accessible only through minimal-energy regimes.  
- Scientific metaphor: the analogy of the ant, the aircraft carrier, and the matchstick translates the idea that subtlety surpasses brute force in investigating the infinitely small.  

### Potential Impact
This principle redefines experimental physics by proposing that it is not brutality that reveals the micro, but delicacy. The originality of the formula opens space for:
- New experiments in ultra-low energy and temperature regimes.  
- Reinterpretation of quantum phenomena such as superposition and coherence.  
- Exploration of connections between fundamental physics and cosmology.
